## Files downloaded by the tool

The tool downloads or requests information from GitHub's API for various reasons.

### From GitHub `master` repository:

**Checking for updates, "What's new", and translations:**  
```
📁 .
├── 📝 VERSION        ⇨ Downloaded on startup to check for updates.
├── 📝 What's new.rtf ⇨ Downloaded and displayed on versions prior to v1.11.
│
└── 📁 Fo76ini

        ├── 📝 list.iso.txt ⇨ List of available translations for download.
        └── 🗃️ xx-XX.zip    ⇨ Translations
```

### From GitHub releases:

**Updates:**  
Any file that follows the `vx.xx.x_bin.zip` naming scheme. Downloaded and extracted by the auto-updater.

### Using the GitHub API:

**Checking for updates to translations (as of v1.11.4):**  
Checks if any commit to the path `./Fo76ini/languages` has happened since the last update to the translations.

### From felisdiligens.github.io:
Displays [felisdiligens.github.io/Fo76ini/What's new.html](https://felisdiligens.github.io/Fo76ini/What's%20new.html) and [/What's new - Dark.html](https://felisdiligens.github.io/Fo76ini/What's%20new%20-%20Dark.html) in a web browser control.
